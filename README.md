# shoo

Visualize your Social network connections with Shoo.

The idea was to use a JS graph library to visualize user's Facebook and Twitter connections. 
The app worked ok when it was first coded, but might use deprecated APIs now. The bigger idea was to create an application 
that could be used to aggregate data from different social networks and show it to the user in one place. The challenge was
to learn to use the different authentication flows and learning to configure Spring correctly for the different Social
APIs. App can be deployed locally, but has some bugs and as said before, could depend on some old functionality.

The app is developed with Java Spring framework, and was formerly deployed to Heroku.
